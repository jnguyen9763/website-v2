# website-v2

This is the second version of my personal website: https://jnguyen9763.github.io/website-v2/

![Alt Text](https://github.com/jnguyen9763/website-v2/blob/master/assets/images/website/demo.gif)

v1 : https://jnguyen9763.github.io/website-v1

Updates from v1:
- Fully responsive
- Updated landing-page animation
- Sticky navbar
- Overall aesthetics

Some design aspects were inspired by Brittany Chiang's websites (her github: https://github.com/bchiang7/)  
Otherwise, all of the coding was done by me! (besides some code that is cited)
